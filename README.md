# Sneaky Stealer
This is a simple cookie stealer written in Python. The code is based on Madhan Maaz's python cookie stealer (https://github.com/madhanmaaz/marlowe-malwares) with some additional functionality for stealing from Mozilla Firefox in addition to Chrome. I've also added some cleanup functions that will delete the stealer if it does not find the supported browsers, and after a successful data exfil.

I removed the flask server because I wanted to use something lighter to catch the data when it's sent back to the attacker machine.

There is nothing complex or groundbreaking here because I am not a professional and have only been writing code for a year or so.
